                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In a world where security threats on the internet are rapid and ever evolving oneâ€™s information needs to be protected. A good password can be the one thing between losing it all. And when you get hacked it can be an incredibly frustrating time that can make anyone mad.<br><br>This random password generator button allows the user to create passwords for use on any platform at the same time being an outlet of anger. The platform allows users to customize the password outcome while making the main interaction the button that generated the resulting password. Our team wanted to create simplistic utility for a real-life problem that many people face for project 1 in the Human-Computer Interactions II course at the University of Calgary.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Write-up for the concept sketches</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. A game where that is button that pops up and disappears quickly only to reappear somewhere else on the screen. The user must try to catch the button and click on it to win the game. This concept came to me when focusing on the central interaction with a button as I thought with one button as the focus, we could make a user concentrate on the button as it is the singular point to winning a game. This idea was not chosen by the group in the end because it could not offer the utility that we wanted to focus on.<br> 
<br>2. A game where you choose between a photo of a drawing of an animal or a photo of a real animal and select the real one to win. This concept came to me as a simple way to have a button the focused interaction while also incorporating a visual aspect. This idea was not selected by the group because there were better ideas.<br>
<br>3. A game where multiple buttons light up in a pattern and then the user must repeat the pattern by selecting the buttons in the same order to win. This concept came to me as a way to use multiple buttons to interact with at the same time keeping the focus of interplay on theme with a button. However, this idea was not chosen by the group in the end because it could not offer the utility that we wanted to focus on.<br>
<br>4. A game that mimics a slot machine. The user would press a button to spin and then watch the animation. The user would win if they got three of the same icons in a row. This concept came to me as I was idealizing what real world activities needed a single interaction that could be simulated with a button. This idea was not selected by the group because of the idea of gambling was not appropriate for school.<br> 
<br>5. A game where you click as fast as you can for 5 seconds and then as the end the game averages out how many clicks you did per second. This concept came to me because it keeps the focus of interaction to a singular button and objectively meets the requirements. This idea was not selected by the group because of the limited areas of novelty that could be expanded on.<br>
<br>6. A game where there is a slider that travels across a colour scale and the user must stop the slider in the correct area by pressing a button. This concept came to me after visiting the Rec Room on the weekend and playing a similar game. This idea was not chosen by the group because it was too simple and lacked the coolness factor.<br>
<br>7. A platform where you can click a button and it gives you different words and their definition. This concept came to me thinking about minimalism and button interactions as a command. This idea was too simple and was not selected.<br>
<br>8. This platform was an idea around an anime character that could be dressed by interacting with a button. I thought that this concept had the coolness factor and could be innovative on to add more features. I thought of this concept thinking about the types of dress up games of my childhood. In the end this idea was not chosen because there were better ideas in the group<br> 
<br>9. A game where the user would watch a balloon expand and the user would have to stop the expansion within a threshold to win by interacting with a button. This concept came to me after searching for ideas regarding mobile games because a lot of games on the phone are interacted by tapping motions that could be replayed on a web-based version with a button. This idea was not chosen by the group in the end because it was not creative enough.<br>
<br>10. A game where an arrow would move around a target and the user would interact with a button to stop it the arrow in an area to shoot at the target. Wherever the arrow landed determined the points collected. This concept came to me after searching for ideas regarding mobile games and finding that shooting games were very popular. This idea was not selected  in the end because it did not interest the whole team.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. A simple password sketch showing the only interaction is through a singular button than when press gives the user a random password that they can modify afterwards to regenerate a password. This concept is the idea of the password generator in its simplest form and is a good example to build off from.<br> 
<br>2. A password sketch showing the password result being shown in the middle of the page with customizations in the form of check boxes rather than another page. This keeps the interaction of regeneration and creation to a focused button. This concept is an iteration on to the first sketch.<br>
<br>3. A different interface for creating a password where choices are an up and down count to incorporate more password features while the creation button is at the bottom. This concept builds off the previous sketch.<br>
<br>4. This sketch generates the password with an animation on top and allows the user to copy the password by clicking the copy icon on the side in addition to regenerating the password with the same button on the bottom.<br> 
<br>5. Interacting with the button at the bottom will create three random passwords at a time and these passwords can be copied by clicking the icon to the side or regenerated by clicking the same initial button. This concept is a spin on the last sketch to offer different options in a new way.<br> 
<br>6. Interacting with the button will generate custom passwords that the user can adjust and regenerate to use on any platform. This concept is a combination of sketch 6 and 3.<br> 
<br>7. This is fun idea where the user customizes their password features and then interacts with the button to generate many passwords that float around on the next page. The user must then double click on one of the passwords to copy for use. This concept is different from the other ideas while staying true to utility the team kept in mind.<br>
<br>8. This sketch showcases one option for customization for the password in the form a sliding scale to select the length of the password. Thus, the main interaction for the user is to create the password by clicking the button. This concept came to me when thinking about other options for password features and thinking about components of strong passwords.<br>
<br>9. This allows user fill customization of password features. This concept is a combination of sketch 8, 6, and 3.<br>
<br>10. The password in this sketch is generated with toggles instream of amount counters and creates three different passwords to select from. The main interaction is the button as this is how the user will achieve their goal of getting a password. This concept is a spin on sketch 3 and 5 using toggles and buttons only to keep the interaction focus on pressing the button for results.&nbsp;<br><br>In the end, our group decided to collaborate on a sketch of to combine our ideas. Our combination of ideas resulted in sketch number 11. Sketch number 11 is a password generator that allows a user to increase the length of the password by repeatedly clicking the generate password button and customize the password by checking off the options to include upper letters, numbers, and special characters. So, when an a user is angry, button pressing will be a great outlet for emotions while solving the issue with a new password!
<br>The idea is with more interaction with the button the stronger and more complex the password becomes, thus providing a great first line of defense against unauthorized access. The stronger the password, the more protected oneâ€™s computer will be from malicious entities. We ended up choosing this because the idea was a unique spin on the traditional password generator that provided the same real-life utility at the same time as being a creative use of button interaction. For the technical components, the project with constructed with best practice use of java script, css, and html. The team used all aspects in combination to create the working demo. I contributed to the base code to add the ability to add length of password characters through interaction with the button (about 25% of the total code) and sketched up the combined group idea of sketch 11 based off a combined brain storming session with group mates.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/FireHeart2K/CPSC-581" class="text-primary">(link to code)</a></p>
